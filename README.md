# Hashmap

Implement a hashmap including the following features:

1. Constructing a generic map with fixed table size given upfront.

2. Lookup, insertion, and deletion.

3. Standard library classes that fall under the C++ container concept are not allowed (refer to: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/Container)

4. Please include a main program or unit test that checks that the map works.
